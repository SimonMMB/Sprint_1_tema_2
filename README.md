ðŸ“„ EXERCISES DESCRIPTION

LEVEL 1
- Exercise 1
Define a variable of each type (int, double, string, boolean). Print them. Create a constant that includes your name and display it in title format on the screen.

- Exercise 2
Prints "Hello, World!" to the screen using a variable. Then:
    * Converts all characters in the string to uppercase and prints to the screen.
    * Prints the size (length) of the variable to the screen.
    * Prints the string in reverse order.
    * Creates a new variable with the content "This is the PHP course" and prints the concatenation of both strings to the screen.

- Exercise 3
a - Declare two variables X and Y of type int, two variables N and M of type double and assign a value to each. Then, display on the screen for X and Y:
    * The value of each variable.
    * The sum.
    * The remainder.
    * The product.
    * The modulus.
    * For N and M you will do the same.
For all variables (X, Y, N, M):
    * The double of each variable.
    * The sum of all variables.
    * The product of all variables.
b - Create a Calculator function that enters two numbers per parameter, and in a third parameter allows you to add, subtract, multiply or divide the two numbers.

- Exercise 4
Write a program that implements a function that counts up to a certain number. If a certain number is not included, the number must have a default value of 10. In addition, this function must have a second parameter that indicates how much to count (From 1 to 1, from 2 to 2...). The count must be displayed on the screen step by step.
Associative array: information about yourself: name, age, email, favorite food.

- Exercise 5
Write a function to check a student's grade based on the grade. Conditions:
If the grade is 60% or more, the grade should be First Division.
If the grade is between 45% and 59%, the grade should be Second Division.
If the grade is between 33% to 44%, the grade should be Third Division.
If the grade is less than 33%, the student will fail.

- Exercise 6
Charlie bit my finger! Charlie will bite your finger exactly 50% of the time. Write the isBitten() function that returns TRUE with a 50% probability and FALSE otherwise.

LEVEL 2
- Exercise 1
Write a function that determines the total amount to pay for a telephone call according to the following premises:
Any call that lasts less than 3 minutes has a cost of 10 cents.
Each additional minute after the first 3 is a meter step and costs 5 cents.

- Exercise 2
Imagine that we are in a store that sells:
Chocolate: 1 euro
Chewing gum: 0.50 euros
Candies: 1.50 euros
Implement a program that allows you to add calculations to a total of purchases of this type. For example, if we buy: 2 chocolates, 1 gum and 1 candy, let's have a program that allows us to add the subtotals to a total, such that: function(2 chocolates) + function(1 gum) + function(1 candy) = 2 + 0.5 + 1.5.
Therefore, the total is 4.

LEVEL 3
- Exercise 1
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm designed to find prime numbers within a given range. Based on the information in the attached link, implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes within a function, so that we can invoke the function for a specific number.
